# Fight Club

## Welcome to Fight Club:

This project is our second group project at the University of Denver coding boot camp.

## How it works:

Fight club is an app that will give you the option of choosing four different characters pulled from a mysql database table at the start of the game. You will be put up against a random opponent pulled from a different table in the mysql. You are given two different options for attacking and your opponents attack stats are hidden. You can sign up and login to keep track of your scores. Your score will be tallied and stored into a different table in mysql. At the end of the game your score will be displayed to see how you stack up against other players.

# Future Development:

We are currently working to be able to battle against more then one opponent in a more tournament type format. We are working on removing the logout button from the nav bar if no one is logged in as well. Last, we are trying to add a create character function so that users will be able to use their own characters.
